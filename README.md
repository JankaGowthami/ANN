# Image Processing Pipeline for Contour Detection

## Project Overview
This project implements an image processing pipeline to detect and highlight contours in images. The process involves converting images to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur for noise reduction, performing binary thresholding, and detecting contours. Inspired by Tikhonov regularization, this approach stabilizes and enhances the image processing results.

## Objectives
- Understand and apply Tikhonov's principles for image stabilization.
- Implement an image processing pipeline using OpenCV.
- Accurately detect and highlight contours in images.
- Document the process and findings comprehensively.

## Theoretical Background

### Tikhonov Regularization
Tikhonov regularization is a technique used to solve ill-posed problems by adding a regularization term to the objective function. This helps stabilize solutions by penalizing large or unstable coefficients, reducing noise, and enhancing important features in image processing.

### Contours
Contours are curves that connect continuous points along a boundary with the same color or intensity. They are used extensively in image processing for object detection, shape analysis, and recognition, typically detected in binary images where objects are distinctly separated from the background.

## Implementation
This project uses the following libraries:
- **OpenCV (cv2):** For image processing functions.
- **NumPy:** For numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib:** For displaying images.

The detailed code is available in the `Python_code.txt` file included in this repository.

## Results
After applying the Tikhonov filter, the processed image will have its contours highlighted in green, demonstrating the effectiveness of the image processing pipeline in detecting and outlining the shapes within the image.

## Conclusion
This project successfully implements an image processing pipeline that applies principles inspired by Tikhonov regularization to detect and highlight contours in images. By reducing noise and stabilizing the data through Gaussian blur, the contour detection process becomes more robust and reliable.

## Future Work
- Enhance the Contour Detection Algorithm: Experiment with different thresholding techniques and contour detection methods to improve accuracy.
- Apply to Different Image Types: Test the pipeline on various types of images, including medical, satellite, and microscopic images.
- Integrate Machine Learning: Use machine learning algorithms to further enhance contour detection and object recognition.
